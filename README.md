# Credit Card Checker  
  
This project is part of the **Full-Stack Engineer** course on codecademy.com  
  
## Project Goals  
The aim of the project is to create some functions in JS to check if provided credit cards numbers, stored in arrays, are valid or not.  
The instructions do not provide step by step guidelines but only the requirements.  
  
Every function has detailed comments explaining the purpose.
